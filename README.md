remote-control
==============

This is kind of a remote control. There will be server and client. Let's say a server runs on windows/linux and client is running on mobile devices. Server program simulates all the events (mouse/keyboard) which generated from the Client devices. Communication is done through the LAN. For time limitation currently we will develop the windows(server) and android(client) part.
